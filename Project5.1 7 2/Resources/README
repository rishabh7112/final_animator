The purpose of our program is to display animations.

Views:
- We added another interface in our cs3500.animator.view called IView that
extends IAnimationView and ActionListener. This interface contains a secActionListener method,
a makeVisible method, and a setTick method.
- We created the InteractiveView class that extends our VisualView class and
implements the IView interface next. We created various JButton fields to indicate
different user commands when running the animation (start, resume, pause, restart)

Controller:
- We created an interface called IController which contains a run method.
- All of the views have the run method to execute and render the appropriate animations.
- We created an InteractiveController class that implements IController and ActionListener.
This class contains fields that take in the view and timer. The actionPerformed method
 registers a button click and changes the animation accordingly.
- We created a Controller class that implements IController. It contains fields that take in the
view. All the views except for the InteractiveView class use this Controller.

We made a BubbleSort class that runs an animation using a bubble sort algorithm.

We also added in an IViewModel interface which is a readable version of the IAnimatorModel.
We passed in the IViewModel instead of the IAnimatorModel in the views so that the view cannot
mutate the model.

We added another ViewType to our Enum representing an InteractiveView.

Changes:
- In our Excellence class we checked if the view type is of a certain view, then we make the
controller run the appropriate commands to render the animation.
